# PolicyBuddy

This project uses machine learning to find different policies by interacting with a bot. The bot helps you find the policies you are looking for by asking you questions about your needs and preferences. Once the bot has a good understanding of what you are looking for, it will use machine learning to find the most relevant policies.
